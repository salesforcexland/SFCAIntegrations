# Salesforce Code Analyzer for Azure DevOps

This extension allows you to run Salesforce Code Analyzer v5 on the changed files in a pull request, or against an entire branch. It reports code violations, publishes results, and can fail the build to let you block merges or identify technical debt in your overall codebase. It follows a fail fast approach if there's no relevant files and skips the rest of the logic, gives you artifacts to analyse after a valid run, and provides detailed logs and feedback to that PR once complete.

## Key Features

- Threshold capabilities for the amount of issues you would accept before failing the build, or any issues above a particular severity
- Installs and uses the latest version of Salesforce Code Analyzer, currently v5
- Scans an entire selected branch (as a one-off or scheduled run using cron) if desired
- Can also scan only changed files in PRs (delta scanning), using dynamic engine selection of the code-analyzer package
- Utilise the code-analyzer.yml file for custom configuration, and specify particular engines/tags to focus the scan
- Outputs results as artifacts (html report, json file, and each changed file) for investigation
- Optional PR status check/comments POST onto the PR for extra visibility

## Requirements

- Currently this extension works for Azure and GitHub Repositories (detail [here](#github-support)), linking into Azure Pipelines as the runner (needs an available agent)
- Pipeline must run on `ubuntu-latest`
- Node.js 20+ and Python 3.10+ must be available (these are already baked into ubuntu-latest, but you can explicitly check via `UseNode@1` and `UsePythonVersion@0` if necessary)
- `checkout` step must override `fetchDepth` to 0 (no shallow fetching) for proper git diffing (if running on PRs)
- PR build validation policies must be set up to control trigger behavior for ADO repos, or the 'pr' property for GitHub repos
- See [here](#-required-permissions) for permission detail

## üñ•Ô∏è GitHub support
- You can also use a GitHub repository for the code, and ADO pipelines as the orchestration engine to run the scan and store the results
- To configure this, follow the necessary steps [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) to build an ADO Pipeline using the GitHub repo as the source, taking notes on the revelant permissions and .yml differences for PR triggers
- Also make sure `persistCredentials: true` is passed into the checkout step due to oddities in retrieving branches from GitHub for git diffing
- For the GitHub token, you need at least 'Read access to metadata' and 'Read and Write access to commit statuses and pull requests' for comments back to the PR, and to include it in the .yml as follows:

```yaml
env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: $(GITHUB_TOKEN)
```
- See [screenshots](#Ô∏è-screenshots) for more info

## Usage

1. Install this extension in your Azure DevOps organization.
2. Add the task `Salesforce Code Analyzer - ADO Scan` to a YAML or Classic build pipeline, using the below example.
3. Assess parameters like `maximumViolations` or `postStatusCheckToPR` to create the right combination for your checks, as outlined below.
4. Consider whether you'd like SFCA to run on PRs only, full branches, or a combination of both (second example)
5. Consider if you would like to fail builds on total violations, or any issues above a particular severity threshold as outlined [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_code-analyzer_commands_unified.htm#:~:text=t%20%7C%20%2D%2D-,severity,-%2Dthreshold%20SEVERITY%2DTHRESHOLD).
   - I'd recommend using the 'useSeverityThreshold' capability to be much more specific around what types of violation you'd like to fail builds on, rather than total violations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Code Analyzer.yml
- With code analyzer v5, you can use a code-analyzer.yml configuration file (explained in detail [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/config-custom.html)) to control engines, tags, severities, and much more
- This extension can leverage that custom configuration file in your scans for both PRs and full branch scans
- In testing I've placed this file in a 'config' folder at the root of the repository, and referenced it as so in the parameter './config/code-analyzer.yml' to grab the file and copy it into the runner for use, so make sure it's accessible
- Certain **caveats** are below:
  - You need to ensure the code-analyzer.yml file is present on all branches relevant for PR/full scans, or it'll get skipped
  - Consider starting with the example yml files i've provided HERE, with example log/rule overrides
  - There is currently a lack of support for extra config files (eslint, pmd etc) due to a relative path problem - this will be tackled in a future update
  - This could also contradict/cause confusion with the severity threshold and rule selector in terms of severities scanned and reported on

---

## üìè Rule selector
- You can also customise which engines/rules/tags you want to run (explained in detail [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/analyze.html#run-the-rules-on-your-code-base)) as part of the runner
- This extension defaults to the 'Recommended' tag across multiple engines, and the scanner dynamically determines which engines need to run based on this
- You can customise this to run particular engines (e.g pmd, eslint), particular tags (e.g Recommended, Security), a combination of engine/tag (e.g pmd:BestPractices), or include severity also (e.g cpd:Design:5)
- Certain **caveats** are below:
  - If you use the code-analyzer.yml file and severity threshold parameters, there may be discrepancies between the severities reported
  - If you select a particular tag, it could trigger unexpected engines if they're not disabled (e.g 'Apex' would trigger the 'sfge' graph engine)
  - If you pass in an incorrect value here, it won't cause the scanner to fail, and may just run with 0 rules (verify this in the logs)

## üîê Required Permissions

For ADO repos, if `postStatusCheckToPR` or `postCommentsToPR` are `true`, you must add the following to your pipeline YAML:

```yaml
env:
  SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
```
This allows the task to authenticate against the Azure DevOps API to post the result, as long as your build service user has the 'Contribute to Pull Requests' permission.

---

## Example usage - PRs (ADO)

```yaml 
trigger: none 
pr: none      # We don't need any branch/PR triggers here as we'll control it with Build Policies

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  - checkout: self
    fetchDepth: 0 # Make sure we're overriding 'shallow fetch' here to retrieve all git history
  # Custom task below handles package installs (dependencies are already present in ubuntu-latest), scanning, analysis and publishing of results
  - task: run-salesforce-code-analyzer@1 # Call the custom task for SF Code Analyzer analysis
    inputs:
        stopOnViolations: true
        useSeverityThreshold: true
        severityThreshold: '3'  # Moderate and above
        extensionsToScan: "cls|trigger|js|html|page|cmp|component|(?:page|cls|trigger|component|js|flow)-meta\\.xml" # Include meta xml files of these components to check for old versions
        postStatusCheckToPR: false
        postCommentsToPR: false
```

  - If you were to set `postStatusCheckToPR` or `postCommentsToPR` to be `true`, you need to make sure you pass in your SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN too so it can leverage your permissions to Contribute to Pull Requests.
  - An example is shown below for how you could do this, making sure you include any other relevant variables in the 'inputs':
```yaml
    inputs:
        postStatusCheckToPR: true
        postCommentsToPR: true
    env: 
        SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
```

## Example usage - Full branch scans & PRs (ADO, in 1 yml, using conditions, with a config file/rule selection)

```yaml 
trigger: none 
pr: none      # We don't need any branch/PR triggers here as we'll control it with Build Policies

schedules:
  - cron: "45 20 * * *" # Modify this accordingly to run on the right schedule
    displayName: "Daily 21:45 BST run"
    branches:
      include:
        - feature/SFCA-Custom-Task-Testing-v2 # Change this to be the full branch you want to scan, e.g 'main' or 'staging'
    always: true

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  - checkout: self
    fetchDepth: 0 # Make sure we're overriding 'shallow fetch' here to retrieve all git history

  # Run this only if it's a PR
  - task: run-salesforce-code-analyzer@1
    displayName: Run SFCA for PR
    condition: eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')
    inputs:
      stopOnViolations: true
      useSeverityThreshold: true
      severityThreshold: '3'
      extensionsToScan: "cls|trigger|js|html|page|cmp|component|(?:page|cls|trigger|component|js|flow)-meta\\.xml"
      postStatusCheckToPR: true
      postCommentsToPR: true
      configFilePath: './config/code-analyzer-full.yml'
      ruleSelector: 'Recommended'
    env:
      SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)

  # Run this only if it's *not* a PR (manual/CI/schedule) - this is dynamically determined
  - task: run-salesforce-code-analyzer@1
    displayName: Run SFCA for Manual/CI/Scheduled
    condition: ne(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')
    inputs:
      stopOnViolations: false
      useSeverityThreshold: true
      severityThreshold: '3'
      scanFullBranch: true
```

## Example usage - Full branch scans & PRs (Github repo, in 1 yml, for PRs targeting the 'uat' branch)

```yaml 
trigger: none 
pr: 
  - uat

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  - checkout: self
    fetchDepth: 0
    persistCredentials: true

  # Run this only if it's a PR
  - task: run-salesforce-code-analyzer-dev@1
    displayName: Run SFCA for PR
    condition: eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')
    inputs:
      stopOnViolations: true
      useSeverityThreshold: true
      severityThreshold: '3'
      extensionsToScan: "cls|trigger|js|html|page|cmp|component|(?:page|cls|trigger|component|js|flow)-meta\\.xml"
      postCommentsToPR: true
      configFilePath: './config/code-analyzer-full.yml'
      ruleSelector: 'Recommended'
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: $(GITHUB_TOKEN)

  # Run this only if it's *not* a PR (manual/CI/schedule) - this is dynamically determined
  - task: run-salesforce-code-analyzer-dev@1
    displayName: Run SFCA for Manual/CI/Scheduled
    condition: ne(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')
    inputs:
      stopOnViolations: false
      scanFullBranch: true
```
